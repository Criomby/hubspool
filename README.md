<br>
<br>
<li><strong>Print all:</strong><br>
Prints out the first 5 top and bottom rows, to see if the file is correct.<br</li>
<li><strong>Counts:</strong><br>
1. Counts the all different lead categorie and number of entries in them.<br></li>
2. Counts all industries and number of entries in them.<br>
<li><strong>Topleads:</strong><br>
Counts the compnaies in the top 3 lead categories, closest to a deal: 'Follow-up', 'Qualified Lead' & 'Contract'<br></li>
<li><strong>Leads by industries:</strong><br>
Counts the industries and the different lead status in them and ho many companies in each industry belong to each lead status respectively.<br></li>
<li><strong>Pitches:</strong><br>
Prints a table of each company that has a pitch scheduled and the data within the pitch information entry.<br></li>
</ul>
<br>

## Recommendations: <br>
The program gets every industry and lead status from HubSpot without any changes to the initial setup required. <br>
However, some functions can perform additional analyses through changes to the HubSpot data structure / setup.<br>
The function 'Counts' automatically gets every industry and lead status from HubSpot and counts their occurrence.<br>
Additionally, with the following lead status & industry categories configured in HubSpot, the function puts out a custom sorted table that can be exported:<br>
<br>
<strong>(If you use different categories, they will still be shown and analyzed, but sorted by size and not custom sorted as shown below)</strong><br>
- Cold
- Cold Contacted
- Warm
- Follow-up
- Qualified Lead
- Contract
- Rejected
<br>
<ul>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Financial Services</li>
<li>Mobility</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Telecommunications</li>
<li>eCommerce</li>
<li>Online Broker</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Government</li>
</ul>
<br>
Of course you are free to change the categories for custom sort in the source code should you require different ones.<br>
For the function 'Pitches', a company information entry has to be set up in HubSpot, where the pitch information is inserted with the following structure:<br>
<br>
<em>(Closed / Open) YY.MM.DD, time, location</em><br>
(again, you are free to enter whatever you like here and the function still works, the output just might not be ideal without changes to the sort command)<br>
