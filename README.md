<h2>Support:</h2><br>
<strong>I don't know where to find my filepath:</strong><br>
Go to your targetfile > open properties > details > copy the folder path + add the name of your file to the end of it + .csv. <br>
<br>
<strong>The file is not saved when I press 'Safe to .csv':</strong><br>
You have probably forgotten to change the name for the next savefile after your last safe.<br>
Since the program does not override existing fles, it just does nothing.<br>
In the next version an error messge will be printed for that error.<br>
<br>
<strong>The wrong table is exported when I press 'save to':</strong><br>
The program always saves the last function you have printed / pressed. <br>
Make sure the right table is shown in the textfield on top before you save.<br>
<br>
<strong>There is only one table printed when I press 'save to':</strong><br>
Currently the program only saves the last function / table you have pressed. <br>
If you want to save multiple functions, you have to press the button, save it and repeat with each other function.<br>
The ability to save multiple tables at once will be included in a future version. <br>
<br>
The .exe will be updated on demand, so always check the latest release version before downloading. <br>
The .py scripts will always be on their latest version. <br>
