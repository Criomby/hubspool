<br>

## Recommendations: <br>
The program gets every industry and lead status from HubSpot without any changes to the initial setup required. <br>
However, some functions can perform additional analyses through changes to the HubSpot data structure / setup.<br>
The function 'Counts' automatically gets every industry and lead status from HubSpot and counts their occurrence.<br>
Additionally, with the following lead status & industry categories configured in HubSpot, the function puts out a custom sorted table that can be exported:<br>
<br>
<strong>(If you use different categories, they will still be shown and analyzed, but sorted by size and not custom sorted as shown below)</strong><br>
- Cold
- Cold Contacted
- Warm
- Follow-up
- Qualified Lead
- Contract
- Rejected
<br>
<ul>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Financial Services</li>
<li>Mobility</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Telecommunications</li>
<li>eCommerce</li>
<li>Online Broker</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Government</li>
</ul>
<br>
Of course you are free to change the categories for custom sort in the source code should you require different ones.<br>
For the function 'Pitches', a company information entry has to be set up in HubSpot, where the pitch information is inserted with the following structure:<br>
<br>
<em>(Closed / Open) date, time, location</em><br>
(again, you are free to enter whatever you like here and the function still works, the output just might not be ideal without changes to the sort command)<br>
<br>

<h2>Support:</h2><br>
<strong>I don't know where to find my filepath:</strong><br>
Go to your targetfile > open properties > details > copy the folder path + add the name of your file to the end of it + .csv. <br>
<br>
<strong>The file is not saved when I press 'Safe to .csv':</strong><br>
You have probably forgotten to change the name for the next savefile after your last safe.<br>
Since the program does not override existing fles, it prints an error message, stating that the file already exists.<br>
In that case you have two options: 1. Define a new save path / name for your new file, or 2. delete the existing file.<br>
<br>
<strong>The wrong table is exported when I press 'save to':</strong><br>
The program always saves the last function you have printed / pressed. <br>
Make sure the right table is shown in the textfield on top before you save.<br>
<br>
<strong>There is only one table printed when I press 'save to':</strong><br>
Currently the program only saves the last function / table you have pressed. <br>
If you want to save multiple functions, you have to press the button, save it and repeat with each other function.<br>
The ability to save multiple tables at once will be included in a future version. <br>
